We can imagine generating the internal address by making a sequence of guesses as to what the period of a kneading sequence is. We will look at the sequence one term at a time and make the smallest possible guess consistent with the amount of the sequence we have seen so far. The first term of the internal address is always 1, corresponding to the guess that the sequence is constant. The second term in the kneading sequence is the smallest index of a term which is different from the first. 

## Angled Internal Addresses
Internal addresses specify kneading sequences, but kneading sequences do not uniquely specify hyperbolic components. To distinguish between hyperbolic components we can use angled internal addresses.
### Denominators of Angled Internal Addresses
These are determined uniquely by the un-angled internal address
### Numerators of Angled Internal Addresses
These can be chosen freely among the positive integers coprime to the denominator
